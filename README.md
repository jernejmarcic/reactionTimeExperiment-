# A1- Reaction Time Experiment (1)

- Our experiment is going to test users on their reaction times to two different arrow directions. 

- The objective of this exam is to test the reaction time of users when reacting to a right or a left arrow pointer, with the goal of testing for any variation in reaction time between the two arrows.

## Experiment design:

 - 2 different  arrow directions will be displayed sequentially with a white screen cooldown period in between. The goal is for the user to press the spacebar when they perceive either a right or left arrow on the screen.

 - There will be a random delay between 2-5 seconds before each new arrow direction/trial

 - Each user will perform 10 trials to create an accurate mean time to account for any inconsistencies(5 of each direction appearing randomly).

 - The reaction time of each direction will be stored and averaged (5 of each per user) and then tested by 5 users also averaged giving the final mean reaction time.
